== Gifts sample app

This is a simple gift-giving application that uses REST requests to OpenSocial endpoints.


== Getting Started

1. Move this directory to the location from which you'd like to serve your content.
2. Start a server (webrick, mongrel, thin, passenger, etc.) with this app, on port 80.
3. Edit the app XML in public/gifts.xml to point to http://yourserver.com/gifts/iframe.
4. Register the app XML to get your HMAC consumer key and secret, and add these to
gifts_controller.rb.
5. Load the gadget in your social network.
